    <ol>
        <li>prepare the empanada dough..... cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>grate the mozzarella and chedder and place them into a medium bowl, then add half of the parmesan cheese AND half a cup of the marinara sauce and then mix it good</li>
        <li>preheat the oven to 400 degrees farenheight and divide the dough into 20 small pieces (like 50 g each) and gently roll each into a little ball :)</li>
        <li>
            okay im bored now im just gonna copy and paste the rest of the recipe LMAOO XP
            <p>On a lightly floured surface, take 1 ball of dough and roll it out into about a 4- to 5-inch diameter circle. Place 1 tablespoon of the cheese filling and one pepperoni (or another filling of choice) on the middle of the dough circle. Gently fold the circle in half to form a half-moon shape, sealing the edges firmly together with your fingers. Fold the edge over itself decoratively (see how to fill and shape empanadas).
            
            Place the empanada on a cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining balls of dough.
            
            Mix egg yolk with 1 tablespoons water. Lightly brush egg mixture over tops and sides of the empanadas. Sprinkle empanadas with remaining grated Parmesan cheese.
            
            Place empanadas in the oven and bake until puffed, shiny, and golden brownâ€”about 20 to 25 minutes.
            
            Serve warm with marinara sauce for dipping.</p></li>
